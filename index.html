                        The first implementation of the app was developed using the <strong>Ionic</strong> framework. 
                        The second implementation of the app was developed with the <strong>React Native</strong> 
                        framework. Each of these implementations used Google Firebase for user authentication, 
                        and Cloud Firestore for persistent data storage.

                    <p>
                        I found that the implementation of the app was most difficult when using the React Native 
                        framework. I do believe this was solely due to my lack of experience with the framework 
                        combined with its steep learning curve. I do like how much control you have over the 
                        app though as the development process is very modular.

                        This is the bulk of the Discord Bot. It really brings the community together as each person 
                        shares their loot, which otherwise becomes a mystery. There are some additional features that 
                        I have also integrated into the bot:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moderation tools - (kicking/banning/warning) users.</li>
                            <li>Auto-updating ranked role system based on how many submissions a user has.</li>
                            <li>User authentication via messaging the bot upon entering the server, 
                                which checks whether the given username is a valid StarBreak username or not.</li>
                            <li>Restricting reaction emojis to only emojis that are contained in each submission.</li>
                        </ul>

                        as it ensured there were no potential cross-referencing problems.

                        I developed scripts using the engine's scripting language called GDscript 
                        (which is similar to Python) to control the logic of each entity in the game. I have also 
                        implemented persistent game saving and loading functionality via local device storage. 
                        The game is currently still in development.

                        This game was developed in a team of five members for a group project for SWEN222 
                        (back in early 2017). The game was developed using vanilla Java without the use of any external 
                        frameworks or libraries. Different components of the game were designated to each team member,
                        and I ended up being responsible for the map rendering, loading, and saving. 
                        The map utilised a tile system which made saving and loading much more simple.
